### BREAKING CHANGES

* No longer load `deep_merge`'s monkey patch for `Hash#deep_merge` and `Hash#deep_merge!` ([#342](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/342)). If you rely on those methods and are not using Rails / Active Support, you can load the monkey patch via `require 'deep_merge/deep_merge_hash'`. This change fixes Rails 7.x support.

* Fix indentation warning in Ruby 3.1 ([#322](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/322))

## 4.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Rails versions `< 5.2` are no longer supported ([#316](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/316))
* Ruby versions `< 2.6` are no longer supported ([#316](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/316))
* Support `HashSource` and `EnvSource` instances in `Config.load_files` and `Config.load_and_set_settings`. ([#315](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/315)). There are a few subtle breaking changes:
  * Previously, `Config.load_files` (called from `Config.load_and_set_settings`) would call `.to_s` on each of its arguments. Now, this responsibility is deferred to YAMLSource. In effect, if your application passes String or Pathname objects to `Config.load_files`, no changes are necessary, but if you were somehow relying on the `.to_s` call for some other type of object, you'll now need to call `.to_s` on that object before passing it to `Config`.
  * Before this change, `Config.load_files` would call `uniq` on its argument array. This call has been removed, so duplicate file paths are not removed before further processing. In some cases, this can cause differences in behavior since later config files override the values in earlier ones. In most cases, it's best to ensure that duplicate paths are not passed to `Config.load_files`.

## 3.1.1

### Bug fixes

* Allow the use of unsafe YAML parsing features when using psych >= 4 ([#306](https://github.com/railsconfig/config/issues/306))

## 3.1.0

### New features

* Evaluating ERB in YAML files can now be disabled with `Config.evaluate_erb_in_yaml = false`. The default value for this option is `true` for backwards-compatibility. ([#303](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/303))

## 3.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

* After upgrade behaviour of `to_h` would change and match behaviour of `to_hash`. Check [#217](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/issues/217#issuecomment-741953382) for more details.
* `Config::Options#load_env!` and `Config::Options#reload_env!` have been removed. If you need to reload settings after modifying the `ENV` hash, use `Config.reload!` or `Config::Options#reload!` instead.

### Bug fixes

* Added alias `to_h` for `to_hash` ([#277](https://github.com/railsconfig/config/issues/277))

### Changes

## 2.2.3

### Bug fixes

* Defer modification of `ActionController::Base` to when it is loaded in Rails integration ([#250](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/250))

### Bug fixes

* Fix missing new_ostruct_member in Ruby 2.7 ([#255](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config/pull/255))
